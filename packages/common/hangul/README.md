# @toss/hangul

A library to handle [Hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul) (Korean) characters, in modern JavaScript.

## Deprecation Notice

Please note that `@toss/hangul` has been deprecated. We have transitioned to a new package, `es-hangul`, which offers improved functionality and performance.

### Recommended Actions:

- Update your dependencies to use `es-hangul`.
- Refer to the `es-hangul` documentation for new features and implementation details.

Thank you for your continued support and understanding.

## Documentation

For more information about `es-hangul`, please visit [es-hangul documentation](https://es-hangul.slash.page/).

## Motivation

In Korean services, there are cases where we have to handle Hangul characters in a sophisticated way. For example, when searching among Korean strings, most Koreans expect to search `토스` with `톳`, or `토스` with `ㅌㅅ`.

`@toss/hangul` provides fundamental constructs to handle these Hangul strings.
