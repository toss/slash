Slash is a collection of TypeScript/JavaScript packages used in [Toss](https://toss.im). It provides over 30 npm packages which can serve as a foundation to provide high-quality web services.

They include [@toss/utils](https://github.com/toss/slash/blob/main/packages/common/utils) and [@toss/hangul](https://github.com/toss/slash/blob/main/packages/common/hangul).
- [**react**](https://github.com/toss/slash/blob/main/packages/react): Components, hooks or utility functions that can be used when developing web services in React.

## Project Status

- Slash is a legacy project and is not currently being maintained.
- Many of Slash's useful features will be separated into several individual packages that are currently under development.
  - [es-hangul](https://github.com/toss/es-hangul) is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to work with Hangul.
  - [es-toolkit](https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit) is a modern JavaScript utility library with high performance, small bundle size, and strong types.
  - [suspensive](https://github.com/toss/suspensive) is a JavaScript library that elegantly handles React's suspense and error boundaries.
- If you would like to contribute to Slash, please contribute to these packages, not Slash.
